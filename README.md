### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a 5th-year **Computer Engineering** student at FCEFyN - UNC.  
My focus has shifted towards the world of **Backend Development and DevOps**, where I enjoy building scalable systems and automating workflows.

Currently, I'm a **Teaching Assistant** for the "Software and Hardware Engineering" course, where I help other students navigate the intersection of code and systems. I’m passionate about technical excellence, which is why I apply **TDD, CI/CD, and clean architecture** in my personal projects.

Beyond coding, I'm exploring advanced mathematics (Topology and Logic) as a personal challenge, and I’m a dedicated piano enthusiast. 🎹
