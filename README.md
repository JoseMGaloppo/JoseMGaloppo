### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm José, a Computer Engineering student from Córdoba, Argentina 🇦🇷.  
I have a deep interest in both software development and electronics, and I’m especially passionate about creating practical solutions through code and hardware integration.

☕ Java is my primary programming language and a key part of how I think and approach problems.  
🔌 I enjoy working on embedded systems using microcontrollers such as the PIC16F887, combining low-level control with real-world interaction.  
🧠 I'm continuously learning about software design, architecture patterns, and best practices to build scalable and maintainable systems.  
📱 I'm also starting to explore Kotlin to expand my skills in modern Android development.

I'm currently open to internships, collaborative projects, and any opportunities that allow me to grow as a developer and engineer.
